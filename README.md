# Tünerik Koşusu
<strong>Tünerik Koşusu</strong> is a GUI based (java swing) dungeon crawler game where you try to find some meaning as to why you're there in the first place... <br>

This game was my first programming project I've ever made in my life. <br>
This project had some seriously bad code in it, and to be frankly honest it still does... <br>
This project really helped me grow as a programmer by helping me compare myself to my old self. <br>
I tried cleaning up the code as much as I could but it's still a little messy. <br>

You can play this game by downloading the JAR from the releases section if you want. <br>
The game still has few bugs but it's playable-ish... <br>

Whole project was coded by only me (Oğuzhan Topaloğlu) <br>
My friend (Yunus Emre Çay) helped me with few SFX's and most of the graphics so special thanks to him. <br>

This project uses my java swing extension: <a href="https://github.com/oziris78/better-swing">better-swing</a>
